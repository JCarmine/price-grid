# price-grid

This repo contains a price grid example that was built using Vanilla JS. In it, data is received from a mock API that contains information about a specific product and its child variants. Using this data, the JS then executes to visually represent the item’s info (condition, color, availability etc.) in a grid format. At this point, the user can see what product variants are available for selection, and click on a specific combination to add it to cart.

Granted, the styling isn’t the best, but this simple example shows the core functionality of the feature.
